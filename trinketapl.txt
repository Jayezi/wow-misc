sync_up is when resonating_arrow or trueshot is up
strong_sync_up is when
	kyrian: resonating_arrow and trueshot are both up
	non-kyrian: trueshot is up

use this trinket if:
it is a buff trinket or we are kyrian and it is a buff or on-use trinket and
	we're in a major spec cooldown and covenant cooldown combo and
		we are not kyrian and there is no other buff trinket
		or we are kyrian and there is no other buff or on-use trinket
		or the other trinket is on cooldown
		or this trinket is stronger (has a buff and is against a non-buff or shorter cooldown buff, or has a use and is against a shorter on-use)
	or we're not in a major spec cooldown and covenant cooldown combo and
		there is no other buff trinket and
			this total cooldown is less than the next sync
			or the next sync is over half this trinkets total cooldown
		or there is another buff trinket and
			this trinket is stronger (has a buff and is against a shorter cooldown buff) and
				this total cooldown is less than the next sync
				or the next sync is over half this trinkets total cooldown
			or the other trinket is stronger (this does not have a buff or is against a longer cooldown) and
				the other trinket is ready and 
					the other trinket total cooldown is longer than the next sync and
						the next sync is less than half the other trinket total cooldown
				or the other trinket is not ready and
					the other trinket remaining cooldown is shorter than the next strong sync and 
						the next strong sync is over 20 seconds away and
							this trinket total cooldown is less than the next sync
							or the other trinket remaining cooldown is shorter than the next sync and its total cooldown + time to the next sync is less than the next strong sync
							or the next sync is over half this trinket total cooldown
							or we are in a cooldown
					or the other trinket remaining cooldown is longer than the next strong sync and
						this trinket total cooldown is less than the next strong sync
						or this trinket would lose a use if held for the next strong sync
						or this trinket is not a buff trinket and 
							the next sync is over half its total cooldown
							or we are in a cooldown
	or the fight will end before the next sync
or we are not kyrian and it has no buff effect and
	the other is a buff trinket and
		we're not in any cooldown or the other trinket isn't available and
			the next sync is over 20 seconds away or the other trinket won't be usable by the next sync
	or the other is not a buff trinket and
